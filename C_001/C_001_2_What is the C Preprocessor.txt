Q. What is the C Preprocessor?

A. Preprocessor , as the name suggests, is a program that processes our source code before it is passed to a compiler.
   What are Preprocessor directives? What is the Build Process? Does our C source code directly gets passed to the compiler?
   Answer to all these questions is PREPROCESSOR. As we all know there are several steps involved from stage of writing a program to the stage of getting it executed. For example preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking, etc. .
   The combination of all these steps is called Build Process.But let's focus right now on preprocessing.
   Preprocessor works on source code(C program) and creates 'Expanded Source Code'. If the source code is stored in a file PRG1.C then expanded source code is stored in a file PRG1.I. And this expanded source code is sent to the compiler.
   Preprocessor provides many features called preprocessor directives. Each of these preprocessor directives begin with a '#' symbol.
   Following are preprocessor directives:
     (i)   Macro expansion
     (ii)  File inclusion
     (iii) Conditional Compilation
     (iv)  Miscellaneos directives
   These directives can be placed anywhere in a progarm but are usually placed in the beginning of the progarm, before the first function definition.
