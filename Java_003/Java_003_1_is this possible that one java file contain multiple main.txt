Q :- Is this possible that one java file contain multiple main?

A :- Yes, one java file can contain multiple main functions.
		some latest versions of jdk (java developer kit) support multiple main functions in single java file.
		
		let see example...
		here two different classes are there 'Test' & 'Test2'. both the classes have main function. main function of class Test is call main function of class Test2. here make sure that main function have parameter String Array, so you have to pass the String array when time you call main function of Test2 class.
		If you declare main without parameter than compiler shows error.
		Here main of class Test2 can be non static, to do so we have to create object of class Test2.

		let see how to compile & run this program...
		run Test, output must like this.. 
			hello
			it's Test
			it's Test2
		let see what happen..
		when we run Test, "hello" & "it's Test" lines are printed on console. now main of the class 'Test2' is called by the main of the class 'Test' with the String Array 'a'. so line "it's test2" is printed on screen. 
		
		you can run the Test2 with at least one command line argument like "hello guys".
		output must like this..
			hello guys

		either you have to pass the command line argument or modify the code as following.
		replace following line to run Test2..
			System.out.println(a[0]);
		with following line..
			System.out.println("you can type here anything.");
